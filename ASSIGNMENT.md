# Midterm 2

This deliverable asks you to submit your midterm project presentation #2 slides
made using the LaTeX presentation template provided previously. This
deliverable is worth 15% of your grade in this class (along with its delivery
and Q&A). It is due no later than 11:59pm on April 13, 2016. In reality this
presentation is worth much more because it sets the technical underpinnings for
your project.


# Instructions for Com S 641 Midterm Project Presentation 2

0. Your presentation must be between 20-30 minutes.

1. You MUST attribute your sources. For example, if you use a picture or
   a slide from another presentation on that topic then that slide containing
   material from other source should contain a footnote stating where it came
   from. A presentation that does not properly attribute its sources is in
   violation of this class's policy on academic honesty.

2. Add and remove LaTeX files as you see fit, but the main file should be
   presentation.tex. The structure of your presentation can be different from
   the template.

3. DO NOT change the presentation template or theme. We would like each
   presentation theme to look identical throughout the class.

4. Rename the directory to `<teamname>-midterm`.

5. Make sure that the presentation compiles without errors using the
   `Makefile`.

6. Zip the entire presentation directory as `<teamname>proposal.zip` and upload
   it here on blackboard.
